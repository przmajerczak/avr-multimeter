# avr-multimeter
This project's final purpose is to be a resistance, capacitance, (maybe) inductance and volatge gauge in one device based on the Atmega16 microcontroller. By now, there are only resistance and capacitance measurements working, but the rest (including encoder-based "user interface") are under development. Project uses self-written OLED display with ssd1306 chip driver library.

## Summary

###### Under development:
- [ ] encoder-based user interface
###### To be done:
